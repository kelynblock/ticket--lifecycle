Intake, this is where end users submit a ticket. As seen, there's a tab in the picture which has the page open for help desk staff to login & handle tickets. (Obviously, it would not be this way, but the take away is that end users have their own site, http://localhost/osTicket/, to submit tickets).

An agent/helpdesk associate, Vinny Veal, has logged on & can see the open tickets. We'll focus on the most critical ticket here. It's currently unassigned & listed as a normal priority, which certainly requires a higher priority.

</p>
<p>
At this point a Queue Manager would be reviewing these tickets to make sure that their settings are proper. This is what they see as they're changing the priority level. Here the priority is raised, and a brief comment is added.
</p>
<br />

<p>
Next, we see the ticket being assigned along with a brief message. Communication is key!
</p>
<br />

<p>
Here's a view of the updated ticket. Next, we'll see how it looks from the helpdesk portal.
</p>
<br />

<p>
This is what the helpdesk agents portal displays after the changes.

<p>
Again, we have additional communication as the ticket is being worked on.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
At last we have the resolution. The issue has been addressed, communication was ongoing, brief and professional.
</p>
<br />

<p>
The ticket is now closed and moved to the closed tickets category.
